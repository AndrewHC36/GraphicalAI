# GraphicalAI
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AndrewShen31/Hexacone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AndrewShen31/Hexacone)  
This is a graphical software for educational and academic purposes to
make it easier for people to learn Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Machine Learning (ML), and maybe even data visualization.

#### Note: this project is still under heavy development; not for production use yet

### General Information
This software is designed to help people to learn the Artificial
Intelligence quickly and also enables users to quickly prototype their
AI/ML models. Teaches people different kinds of models and how
ML works and not get confused between AI, Neural Network, and ML as I
orignally did.

The core principles of this software is: Flexibility, Simplicity, and
Productive. From begginers to experts, domain-specific to programmer,
acedemic to industry, we try to fit all of them into a nice little
app for everyone to use.

### Purpose
The purpose of this software is to bridge the gap between
the domain experts (i.e. mathematicians, designer) to the programmers
who programs on Python or C++ that has a large and extensive library
to program any kinds of AI/ML models they may need.

### Goal
Future goal of this project is so everyone uses Graphical Interface
(not necessarily this project) to design the AI without any hassle
to prior knowledge of programming. And also create a "lowish"-level
AI designer to be a lot more flexible, creating a variety of AI models,
hence the creation of this project. And its core principles:
Flexibility and Simplicity.

### Software Convention
This software is a visually-rich desktop application to utilize
the simplicity yet complexity of a graphic interface. Much like from
using Command Prompts in the DOS-era to load and manipulate files towards  
the beggining of Graphic Interface to easily navigate file directories,  
system settings, etc.

It uses nodes (a little elongated draggable square with inputs and outputs)
to create the project. Each nodes has input and output connector which
connects to output and input respectively. This allows the user to
understand the relationship between the two nodes and the flow of data
of which is the data is going towards. The user (constant) input on each
nodes are to manipulate how the data from the connections gets manipulated
for greater flexibility.

### Example
Pictures tells more words than a paragraph. As in this case, it does show
some the rusty, messy, early development of this software.

An example of ML in GUI using Linear Regression on iris.csv.
